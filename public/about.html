  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello! I'm Shiv, an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student
     with a curious mind and a love-hate relationship with my branch. 
     I'm exploring full-stack development, web design, and anything 
     that can help me build cool, functional stuff (with or without caffeine).
  </p>

  <p>I thrive on solving real-world problems and have been getting my hands 
    dirty with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bunch of other tech tools. 
    I'm also diving into AI, automation, and anything that gives me 
    the edge to create smarter, faster, and cleaner digital experiences.
  </p>

  <p>When I'm not coding or studying (which is rare), 
    you'll find me questioning the system, cracking jokes, or 
    thinking about why semicolons exist. I'm all about growth â€” technical, 
    personal, and maybe even financial if the code gods are kind.
  </p>
